## Video Script Framework

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Energy companies need accurate demand forecasting to prevent millions in losses. This pipeline combines real-time weather data with energy consumption patterns across 5 major US cities to provide actionable insights for utilities."

### Technical Demo (90 seconds)
"Let me show you the production-ready architecture. The pipeline automatically fetches data from NOAA weather and EIA energy APIs, implements robust error handling, and processes over 3,000 lines of production code. Here's the data quality monitoring in action..."

### Results Showcase (30 seconds)
"The dashboard reveals strong correlations between temperature extremes and energy usage, with R-squared values above 0.7 for most cities. Notice the weekend usage patterns and regional variations..."

### AI Collaboration (30 seconds)
"AI assistance accelerated development by 85%, helping implement complex statistical analysis and interactive visualizations. However, human oversight was essential for integration testing and business logic validation."
